Note, this is ALPHA QUALITY SOFTWARE, and versions after 0.12alpha have a
different interface than .11. Read the documentation for individual
classes for more information. It's not finished yet; if it breaks, you
get to keep both pieces. It requires Perl 5.6.x.

Net::ICal is a set of classes for reading, writing and manipulating
iCalendar data. The iCalendar data units and protocols permit users to
store and retrieve calendar data on remote servers and to schedule
events with other calendar users. For more information on iCalendar,
see the working group's web page at:

	http://www.imc.org/ietf-calendar/

Net::ICal implements RFC 2445; other classes under development 
implement RFC 2446 (Net::ITIP) and RFC 2447 (Net::IMIP). It's one of the
base classes for the Reefknot project, which aims to create 
standards-compliant open-source tools for shared calendaring. 

This is an ALPHA RELEASE; that means that it's not yet feature-complete,
and there are KNOWN BUGS. See the BUGS file for more information on
known bugs as of this release.
