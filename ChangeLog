Net::ICal ChangeLog

(See also the file ChangeLog.detailed in this archive; it's an auto-generated
list from our CVS commit messages.)

Version 0.14, 25 July 2001

* second alpha release by Reefknot; a developers' release to coincide with 
a talk at the O'Reilly Perl Conference. Mostly because we haven't done a release
in a while. Full of known bugs, but we've done a lot since the last release.

* Net::ICal now requires Perl 5.6.x. 

* massive rewrites of Time.pm to be based on Date::ICal.

* added rudimentary code to handle Recurrences. Patches welcome.

* added Net::ICal::Util for general utility routines.

* Began using Pod::Tests to write inline tests; added tests and test skeletons
for the whole module. Started working on the RFC-compliance tests (t/rfc2445.t
and the entire test-data/ directory.)

* bugfixes throughout. 

* minor consistency fixes to standardize code headers and whatnot. 
Moved test/ directory to examples/. 


Version 0.13, March 2001

* first alpha release under the auspices of the Reefknot project.

* MAJOR changes; rewrote Net::ICal in pure Perl instead of as wrappers to libical.
