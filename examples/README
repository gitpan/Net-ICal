README for Net::ICal examples

* cal2fb.pl
   Converts a calendar to a list of times you're free and busy.
   This is in flux, as Freebusy.pm is half-rewritten. 

* freebusy_demo.pl
   Also in flux.
   
* gtk_todo.pl
   You'll need Gnome.pm, Gtk.pm,  and Date::Parse for this

* html_calendar.pl
   You'll need CGI and HTML::CalendarMonthSimple for this

* lunchtime.pl
   Supposed to be a timezone demo; shows what your local lunchtime
   is in a variety of other timezones. Doesn't work now because
   we're still getting timezone handling straightened out. 

* reply.pl
   You'll need MIME::Tools for this one. It reads in a MIME message,
   and will send a reply back saying you won't be coming to the
   first event in the first text/calendar MIME part in the message (if
   present).

* showical.perl
   Shows a little information from events in an iCAL stream in simple
   text format. You could use this to show text/calendar attachments
   in your mailer by putting the following line in your .mailcap:

text/calendar; /path/to/showical.perl '%s'; copiousoutput;

* test(_alarm|_duration|_journal|_todo|cal).pl
   simple scriptlets to show how to create and read back in several
   types of iCAL data. Originally written to test various Net::ICal
   modules.
