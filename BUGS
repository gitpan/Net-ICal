Reported BUGS in Net::ICal
==========================

NOTE FOR Net::ICal 0.14:
This is an old list and we know it; our screen-scraper that generates
these lists broke when Sourceforge changed the HTML on their bug
tracker. If you're interested in helping fix it, post to the 
Reefknot developers' list; see the README for details.

KNOWN 0.14 bugs, in summary:

- tests fail. Sometimes this is because we haven't written tests yet
and have inserted failing tests to mark a location; other times it's
because something really is broken.

- there's an off-by-one-second roundoff error in Time.pm; we're dependent
on Date::ICal for this to work or not. 

Please report any other bugs you see using the Sourceforge bug tracker
(URL below). Thanks.

Summary: Make X-properties work
Submitted by: Shane Landrum (srl)                       Date: 2001-03-25 11:29
Category: Net-ICal
Assigned to: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody)                             Priority: 6

RFC2445 allows user-defined properties: for example: BEGIN:VALARM 
X-FOOBAR;some string the module user wants to toss in 
... 
END:VALARM We need a way to solve this problem. It looks 
non-trivial, but at least one person has asked about it 
on reefknot-users.

Summary: Allow multiple Periods in a FreebusyItem
Submitted by: Shane Landrum (srl)                       Date: 2001-03-25 12:49
Category: Net-ICal
Assigned to: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody)                             Priority: 6

RFC2445 specifies that FREEBUSY items can have multiple 
periods attached to them; right now, we can't do that. 
We should be able to. Someone who knows more than me 
about C::MM should look at this.

srl, could you add a comment to this bug, as you added 
the TODO?

Summary: Quoting of text
Submitted by: Mark Tearle (mtearle)                     Date: 2001-03-01 06:48

Assigned to: Martijn van Beers (lotr)                              Priority: 5

It appears Net::Ical doesn't quote text properly as per 
http://www.imc.org/rfc2739. See message: Subject: Buglet strikes back.... 
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.LNX.4.31.0102192345470.24281-

Summary: Make Recurrence work
Submitted by: Shane Landrum (srl)                       Date: 2001-03-14 08:28
Category: Net-ICal
Assigned to: Scott Hutton (shutton)                                Priority: 5

We need to make sure that we can specify recurring 
events and exceptions to those recurrences. (&quot;Meet 
every Thursday except the 4th Thursday of the month.&quot;)

Summary: Journals documentation
Submitted by: Shane Landrum (srl)                       Date: 2001-03-14 08:30
Category: Net-ICal
Assigned to: Martijn van Beers (lotr)                              Priority: 5

We need to document Journal consistently with Event and 
Todo.

Summary: Bug testing architecture
Submitted by: Shane Landrum (srl)                       Date: 2001-03-14 08:32
Category: Net-ICal
Assigned to: Martijn van Beers (lotr)                              Priority: 5

We need to work on the cross-library testing tools for 
Net::ICal that we talked about. This will be a set of 
iCal files which exercises every feature of the RFC and 
makes sure a library is consistent with the RFC. See 
the mailing list archives for more detail.

Summary: implement Freebusy
Submitted by: Shane Landrum (srl)                       Date: 2001-03-14 08:33
Category: Net-ICal
Assigned to: Shane Landrum (srl)                                   Priority: 5

We need to implement Freebusy---- checking to see when 
a given calendar has time free, for purposes of meeting 
scheduling.

Summary: Make sure that timezones work
Submitted by: Shane Landrum (srl)                       Date: 2001-03-14 08:44
Category: Net-ICal
Assigned to: Martijn van Beers (lotr)                              Priority: 5

We need to verify that conversions between timezones 
work properly. I'm not sure that anyone has looked at 
this in detail.

Summary: N::I::Component return UNDEF on bad data
Submitted by: Shane Landrum (srl)                       Date: 2001-03-14 14:14
Category: Net-ICal
Assigned to: Martijn van Beers (lotr)                              Priority: 5

Net::ICal::Component should return undef; on bad data. 
I've looked at how to fix this. 

bug id: 410798
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Summary: using epoch seconds in Time.pm
Submitted by: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody)                 Date: 2001-03-23 05:16
Category: Net-ICal
Assigned to: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody)                             Priority: 5

Net::ICal::Time(time()) doesn't work properly because 
Time::new_from_int is not called (new_from_string 
handles all). Suggest modifying POD for Time.pm to 
suggest using Net::ICal::Time(gmtime(time())) until 
supported. -Ennui

Summary: SEQUENCE 0 isn't dumped on as_ical()
Submitted by: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody)                 Date: 2001-03-23 05:32
Category: Net-ICal
Assigned to: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody)                             Priority: 5

Setting the sequence manually until it is handled 
internally causes problems for SEQUENCE=0 (I know you 
could assume default but this will apply for any field 
with a zero value). Line 307 of Component.pm has: return unless $value-&gt;{value}; So it returns on a zero value. -Ennui

Summary: Reimplement Duration.pm as a Property
Submitted by: Shane Landrum (srl)                       Date: 2001-03-24 16:19
Category: Net-ICal
Assigned to: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody)                             Priority: 5

Net::ICal::Duration is currently left over from before 
Property existed. It needs to be reimplemented as a 
child class of Property. See N::I::Trigger for a sample 
of how that might be accomplished.

Summary: Make sure we're compliant with section 4.1 of rfc2445
Submitted by: Martijn van Beers (lotr)                  Date: 2001-02-23 02:52
Category: Net-ICal
Assigned to: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody)                             Priority: 5

This includes: * making sure we correctly handle : and ; everywhere 
* handle multiple property values 
* do quoting when needed 
* completely handle folding

Summary: the set function for a map method is too unflexible
Submitted by: Martijn van Beers (lotr)                  Date: 2001-02-23 07:24
Category: Net-ICal
Assigned to: Martijn van Beers (lotr)                              Priority: 5

for example, in Alarm, we have: 
my $t = $args{'trigger'}; 
unless (ref ($t)) { 
$args{'trigger'} = new Net::ICal::Trigger ($t); 
} 
Which should be handled in the set function instead 
(this example is actually a C::MM issue)

Summary: bugs in Time::add and Time::normalize
Submitted by: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody)                 Date: 2001-03-26 09:34
Category: Net-ICal
Assigned to: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody)                             Priority: 5

TIme::add needs the following change: $c-&gt;second($dur-&gt;as_int()); to $c-&gt;second($dur-&gt;as_int() + $c-&gt;second); to maintain the seconds in a time when adding a 
duration. Time::normalise needs to change localtime to gmtime -Ennui

Summary: Problems with : in param-value
Submitted by: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody)                 Date: 2001-03-27 07:19

Assigned to: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody)                             Priority: 5

LOCATION;ALTREP=http://www.morat.net/:Morat Games The parameter is read up to the : after http rather 
than the last colon. Section 4.1.3 of RFC2445 has an 
exmaple like the above and the : isn't quoted out so I 
assume this is incorrect behaviour. Enclosing in quotes 
does not help. -Ennui 

bug id: 411795

Summary: DTEND/DURATION don't work together

Posted on reefknot-users by Ennui: -------------------------------------------- 
If a VEVENT is specified by a duration then 
-&gt;dtend doesn't work and 
vice versa. It would be nice if these were set 
properly. I know methods 
can't be attached because of the use of MethodMapper 
and would confuse 
the writing out of an event if both are defined, but it 
would be very 
useful to not have to program checks into your code. Just a heads up to see if anyone has a good 
solution :)
