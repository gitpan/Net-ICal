Net-ICal Installation Instructions
==================================

#########################################################################
Note, this is ALPHA QUALITY SOFTWARE, and versions after 0.12alpha have a
different interface than .11. Read the documentation for individual
classes for more information. It's not finished yet; if it breaks, you
get to keep both pieces.

OVERVIEW FOR THE IMPATIENT
==========================

For best results, you should be running Perl 5.6.1. It's the latest
stable version, and it's what the developers use. This module
*will not work* under Perl 5.005.

Obtain Class::MethodMapper

      $ perl -MCPAN -e 'install Class::MethodMapper'

Obtain Date::Calc

      $ perl -MCPAN -e 'install Date::Calc'

Obtain Date::ICal

      $ perl -MCPAN -e 'install Date::ICal'

Install the integrated Perl 5 modules into

    a) your existing Perl system under 
       /path/to/existing/perl/area/lib/site_perl/Net/:

      $ perl Makefile.PL
      $ make
      $ make test
      $ make install

    b) a private area of your own under
       /path/to/your/perl/area/lib/site_perl/Net/:

      $ perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/path/to/private/perl/area/
      $ make
      $ make test
      $ make install


DETAILED DESCRIPTION
====================

1. Requirements
   ------------

     Perl 5.005 or greater is required.

     Class::MethodMapper and Date::Calc are required.  These can be obtained 
     via CPAN (http://www.cpan.org/).  Alternatively, if you have the CPAN
     module installed use:
     	$ perl -MCPAN -e 'install Class::MethodMapper'
     	$ perl -MCPAN -e 'install Date::Calc'
     	$ perl -MCPAN -e 'install Date::ICal'
     
2. Configuring the source
   ----------------------

     Configure the ePerl sources via standard MakeMaker procedure 
     for building the Perl 5 interface modules:

        $ [/path/to/bin/]perl Makefile.PL [PREFIX=/path/to/private/perl/area/]

3. Build the object files
   ----------------------

     Now you are ready to run the build process. Start it with a simple
     ``Make'' call:

        $ make

4. Run the Test suite
   ------------------

     You can now run a test suite which will check if the programs work
     correctly before they get finally installed. I highly recommend you to do
     this step, even it is optional and not really required.
     
        $ make test

    (SPECIAL NOTE FOR 0.14: tests are failing; we know this, and it's okay.
    see TODO for how you can help.)

5. Installation
   ------------
     
     Finally install Net-ICal

        $ make install

6. Cleanup
   -------

     Now cleanup the source tree to make it a vanilla distribution again.

        $ make distclean
